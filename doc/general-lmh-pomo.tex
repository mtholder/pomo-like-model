\section {Motivation}
This document is an extension of:\\
 \url{https://github.com/mtholder/pomo-like-model/blob/master/doc/lmh-pomo.tex}\\
that was pulled out for the sake of briefer presentation.

In most phylogenetic datasets we do not anticipate having a lot of info
    on polymorophism.
Nor do we expect to see many cases in which a species shows more than 2 alleles
    at a site.
Nevertheless, the fact that PoMo would assign a likelihood of 0 to such cases, is
    certainly a hurdle to use the general use of the model.

Following the spirit of the data-driven approach described in the lmh-pomo.tex document,
    this document will describe an model with only tenuous connections to the relevant
    population genetics theory.

\subsection*{Notation}
\begin{compactenum}
    \item $N$ is the size of the virtual population.
    \item $\pi_I$ is the frequency of nucleotide $I$ in the mutational model.
    \item $r_{IJ}$ is the symmetric factor in the mutational model.
    So $\mu_{IJ} = \pi_J r_{IJ}$ and $\mu_{JI} = \pi_I r_{IJ}$
    \item $\pi_{w,x,y,z}$ is the equilibrium frequency of a PoMo state that corresponds to
        $w$ members of the virtual population having of \texttt{A}, 
        $x$ members of the virtual population having of \texttt{C},
        $y$ members of the virtual population having of \texttt{G}, 
        $z$ members of the virtual population having of \texttt{T}. Note that $0\leq w, x, y, z$ and
        $z = N- w- x-y$.
    \item $r_{w,x,y,z}^{w^\prime,x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime}$ denotes
    the symmetric factor of the instantaneous rate associated with moving with a virtual population count 
    vector $(w,x,y,z)\leftrightarrow\left({w^\prime,x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime}\right)$
    \item $q_{w,x,y,z}^{w^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime}$ denotes the
    instantaneous rate of with moving with a virtual population count 
    vector $(w,x,y,z)\rightarrow\left({w^\prime,x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime}\right)$.
    By time reversibility:
    $q_{w,x,y,z}^{w^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime} = \pi_{w^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime} r_{w,x,y,z}^{w^\prime,x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime}$
\end{compactenum}

\section*{General-LMH-PoMo}
\begin{compactenum}
    \item $N$ is a fixed-by-the-user virtual population size.
    \item In the diallelic condition, the first allele in the subscript is
    binned into $l$ (low = $1/N$), $m_2$ (mid=0.5), and $h_2$ (high= $(N-1)/N$) frequencies.
    \item In the 3-allelic condition, the first allele in the subscript is
    binned into $l$ (low = $1/N$), $m_3$ (mid=1/3), and $h_3$ (high= $(N-2)/N$) frequencies.
    \item In the 4-allelic condition, the first allele in the subscript is
    binned into $l$ (low = $1/N$), $m_4$ (mid=0.25), and $h_4$ (high= $(N-3)/N$) frequencies.
\end{compactenum}

This would yield 43 states:
\begin{compactenum}
    \item The 4 monomorphic states: $(N,0,0,0)$, $(0,N,0,0)$, $(0,0,N,0)$, and $(0,0,0,N)$.
    \item The 18 dimorphic states. For each of the 6 pairs of nucleotides,
    there would be 3 polymorphic bins such as:
    $(N-1, 1, 0, 0)$, $(N/2,N/2,0,0)$, and $(1, N-1, 0, 0)$.
    \item There are 16 states with 3 alleles. For each of the 4 triples of nucleotides,
    there would be 4 states:
    $(N-2, 1, 1, 0)$, $(1, N-2, 1, 0)$, $(1, 1, N-2, 0)$, and $(N/3, N/3, N/3, 0)$.
    \item There are 5 states with all 4 alleles:
    $(N-3, 1, 1, 1)$, $(1, N-3, 1, 1)$, $(1, 1, N-3, 1)$, $(1, 1, 1, N-3)$ and $(N/4, N/4, N/4, N/4)$.
\end{compactenum}

\subsection*{Parameterization}
This coarse binning breaks the easy connections with the population genetics underpinning.
However, we expect to have quite a bit of data, so we
could estimate an extra parameter to generate the state frequencies, and $Q$ matrix:
\begin{compactitem}
    \item The 3 free parameters needed to yield the 4 equilibrium frequency
    of the mutation process: $1 = \pi_A + \pi_C + \pi_G + \pi_T$
    \item The 5 free parameters needed to yield the 6 symmetric factors
    of the GTR rate matrix:  $\{r_{AC}$, $r_{AG}$, $r_{AT}$, $r_{CG}$, $r_{CT}$, $r_{GT}\}$
    \item Let $f_i$ be the equilibrium probability of their being in a state with $i$ alleles.
    So $1 = \sum_{i=1}^{4}f_i$.
    If $f_3 = f_4 = 0$ then $f_1, = 1- f_2$, this model reduces to the lmh-PoMo
    In the most general parameterization, we would introduce three free parameters for each of the
    non-monomorphic states.
    A promising simplification is to simply introduce 1 new such parameter:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        f_2 & = & \phi \\
        f_3 & = & \phi^2 \\
        f_4 & = & \phi^3 \\
        f_1 & = & 1 - \phi - \phi^2 - \phi^3 \\
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where $0\leq \phi < 0.5436890126920764$ to allow for a non-zero probability of monomorphic condition.
    \item The relative frequency parameter, 
    $\psi = \pi_{IJ}^{(N/2)}/\pi_{IJ}^{(N-1)} = \pi_{IJ}^{(N/2)}/\pi_{IJ}^{(1)}$ is used as in lmh-PoMo.
    This govens the relative abundance of the mid-frequency bin states, given that 
    the state corresponds to a polymorphic condition.

    \item a symmetric rate factor: $\rho$ that governs the relative rate of drift between
    states that correspond to polymorphic for the same pair of nucleotides was introduced for the lmh-PoMo
    model.
    This probably does not need any extension of the general-lmh-PoMo
\end{compactitem}


\subsection*{Connectivity between polymorphic states.}
An ideal form of a general pomo model would have states corresponding to all possible ways of partitionining
    a population of virtual size $N$ into counts for each of the 4 nucleotides.
This would result in a huge number of states for the case of species that are polymorphic for all 4 nucleotides.
This seems very inefficient (given that we don't expect the species to spend much time in such states).

Even when moving to the coarse lmh binning, it would be intuitive to have a large number of states
    for the 3- and 4-allelic conditions.
For example, the $(N-1,1, 0,0) \rightarrow (N-2,1,1,0)$ should be modelled has having an instantaneous rate that
    is proportional to $(N-1)\pi_G r_{AG}$, while an $A\rightarrow G$ mutation in the middle-frequency state
    should occur at a rate of $\frac{N}{2}\pi_G r_{AG}$ and should correspond to a change like:
    $(N/2,N/2, 0,0) \rightarrow (N/2 - 1,N/2,1,0)$.
Unfortunately, this would lead to 10 tri-allelic states for every triple of nucleotides -- because there would need to be 
    a pair of states with very similar frequencies: $(N/2-1,N/2,1,0)$ and $(N/2,N/2 - 1,1,0)$.
For the 4-allelic condition, similar logic would require 23 states.

These large numbers of states for 3- and 4-allelic states seem unlikely to be helpful for phylogenetic inference.
It also seems implausible, that we would be able to reliably fit a lot of parameters that describe the transition 
    rates for these rare states.

So the proposal for the general lmh-pomo model has a much reduce state space.
The $(N-1,1, 0,0) \rightarrow (N-2,1,1,0)$ transition can still occur, but there are not states corresponding to 
``two-nucleotides are common and 1 is rare.''
This means that there is no obviously optimal way to treat mutations when the populartion is in a two-alleles at mid-frequency
    condition.

\subsubsection*{No mutations from the mid-range states}
One simple, though biologically unjustified, solution would be to prohibit the addition of third allele when in a state like $(N/2, N/2, 0, 0)$

This is the choice that will be fleshed out below.

\subsubsection*{Simultaneous mutation and drift}
Although violating the spririt of an ``instantaneous'' rate matrix, we
could allow mutations from $(N/2, N/2, 0, 0)$ to lead to $((N-2)/2, 1, 1, 0)$ and $(1, (N-2)/2, 1, 0)$ states.
This corresponds to a new mutation and fair amount of drift in one event.

One could also consider other mutation+drift events like $(N/2, N/2, 0, 0)\rightarrow(N/3, N/3, N/3, 0)$

\subsection*{Summarizing $Q$ matrix and state frequency calculations for LMH-PoMo}

Monomorphic state freq: 
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{IJ}^{(N)} = \pi_{JI}^{(0)} = \pi_I f_1
\end{equation}

The normalizing constant for comparing the frequencies of different polymorphic states becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \Klmh = \sum_I\sum_{J > I}\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ}
\end{equation}
such that:
    $$\Pr(\mbox{polymorphic for }I, J \mid \mbox{polymorphic}) = \frac{\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ}}{\Klmh}$$

By the definition of the parameter $\phi$, this leads to:
    $$\Pr(\mbox{polymorphic for }I, J) = \frac{\phi\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ}}{\Klmh}$$

Given that the system is in a polymorphic condition, the probablity of being in a low frequency bin is 
    $$\Pr(\mbox{freq =} 1 \mid \mbox{polymorphic}) = \Pr(\mbox{freq =} N -1 \mid \mbox{polymorphic}) = \frac{1}{2 + \psi}.$$
This is also the probability of being in a high frequency bin.
The corresponding probability for the being assigned to the mid-frequency bin is 
$$\Pr(\mbox{freq =} N/2 \mid \mbox{polymorphic}) =  \frac{\psi}{2 + \psi}.$$

Thus, the equilibrium frequency of a low- frequency diallelic state is: 
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{IJ}^{(1)} = \pi_{IJ}^{(N-1)}  =  \frac{\polyProb\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ}}{\Klmh (2 + \psi)}
\end{equation}

The mid-frequency diallelic state: 
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{IJ}^{(N/2)} = \frac{\polyProb\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ}\psi}{\Klmh (2 + \psi)} 
\end{equation}


All elements of $Q$ are 0 between ``non-adjacent'' states are 0.

The diagonal element of the $Q$ matrix is the negative sum of the other elements.

The rate of mutation to introduce state $J$:
\begin{equation}
   Q_{IJ}^{N,N-1} = \mu_{IJ} = \pi_J r_{IJ}.
\end{equation}
In PoMo this includes a factor of $N$, but in our parameterization with $\phi$ as a free parameter, the effect of $N$ simply changes the MLE of $\phi$.

Exploiting time-reversibility:
\begin{eqnarray}
    Q_{IJ}^{N,N-1} & = & \pi_J r_{IJ} \nonumber\\
    & = & \pi_{IJ}^{(N-1)} r_{IJ}^{N, N-1} \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
which enables us to solve for the reversible factor in the introduction/loss of polymorphism
\begin{eqnarray}
  r_{IJ}^{N, N-1} & = & \frac{\pi_J r_{IJ}}{ \pi_{IJ}^{(N-1)}} \nonumber\\
  & = & \frac{\pi_J r_{IJ}\Klmh (2 + \psi)}{ \polyProb\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ}} \nonumber \\
  & = & \frac{\Klmh (2 + \psi)}{ \polyProb\pi_I}
\end{eqnarray}

So the loss of  $J$ to become monomorphic for state $I$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
   Q_{IJ}^{N-1,N} & = & r_{IJ}^{N, N-1} \pi_{IJ}^{(N)} \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{\Klmh (2 + \psi)}{ \polyProb\pi_I} \pi_I (1 -\phi) \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{(1 -\phi) \Klmh (2 + \psi)}{ \polyProb}
\end{eqnarray}

The transitions between the polymorphic states is determined by the new drift parameter:
\begin{eqnarray}
   Q_{IJ}^{N-1,N/2} = Q_{IJ}^{1,N/2} & = & \frac{\polyProb\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ}\psi \rho}{\Klmh (2 + \psi)} \\
   Q_{IJ}^{N/2,N-1} = Q_{IJ}^{N/2,1} & = & \frac{\polyProb\pi_I\pi_J r_{IJ} \rho}{\Klmh (2 + \psi)} 
\end{eqnarray}
